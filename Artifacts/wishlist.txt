TODO:

modal windows

sub menus

validation

loader + interceptor

client side error handling!

put all web stuff in one directory

sort tables

add icons to search buttons

paging


dont forget:
make fields visible according to roles
make sure authorize is set everywhere
delete all todos if any 
remove alerts
remove <pre>
make refresh redirect to same page


bugs:
reportFields -> enter value, delete, send to server, bad request
when already logged in and going to login page, redirect to homepage
set fixed min width for the site so it won't break when minimized
add isNew to to editEmployee (so delete button will be hidden)
format dates normally DD/MM/YYYY
